        description:
            "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are ultra-short flashes of radio light that come from far outside our own Milky Way. In a few thousandths of a second, they can release as much energy as the Sun emits in days. I study these extra-galactic events to understand what produces them and what they reveal about the matter spread between galaxies."

        title: "Why I Listen to the Universe in Radio",
        description:
            "Light is not just what our eyes can see. Radio waves are a form of light with much longer wavelengths, invisible to us but perfect for probing hidden parts of the universe. Using radio telescopes like the uGMRT and the VLA, we combine signals from many antennas to make sharp images and catch brief, faint whispers from distant galaxies. I design observations, analyse FRB signals, and help build the hardware and software that keep these instruments listening."
